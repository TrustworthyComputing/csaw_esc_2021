Equipment Requirements
----------------------

For the virtual finals of the competition in each region, the teams will be asked to present, discuss, and demonstrate their challenge solutions on the Chipwhisperer Nano board. Teams are responsible for any additional equipment their techniques require.

The Chipwhisperer Nano boards and relevant challenge programs will be provided to the finalist teams after the conclusion of the qualification round.


Code of Conduct
---------------

All ESC participants in all regions are subject to the NYU Tandon School of Engineering [student code of conduct](http://engineering.nyu.edu/life/student-affairs/code-of-conduct). Any act of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, unauthorized collaboration across different teams, work duplication, **will not be tolerated and the offenders will be automatically disqualified from the competition**.


Contact Information
-------------------

Teams can contact their regional organizers at the following email address: `csaw-esc@nyu.edu`. To properly route each message and avoid delays in the response, each message must prepend the tag `[US-Canada]`, `[Europe]`, `[MENA]`, or `[India]` in the subject line, depending on the region of the participating team.


Responsible Disclosure
----------------------

In the event that ESC21 contestants find critical, previously undisclosed vulnerabilities during the competition's final phase, we ask that they contact CSAW ESC21 organizers so we can assist and jointly coordinate responsible disclosure procedures, if any such procedures are deemed necessary.
