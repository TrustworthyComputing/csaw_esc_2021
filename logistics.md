The Chipwhisperer Nano boards and relevant challenge programs will be provided to the finalist teams after the conclusion of the qualification round.

Deliverables
------------

For the qualification phase, each participating team must upload **a written report** to the [HotCRP system](https://hotcrp.engineering.nyu.edu/) in PDF file format following the standard IEEE conference format (10pt font, double column, letter size paper, not compsoc mode); templates are available [here](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html) (LaTeX template is preferred). The qualification phase PDF report can be **up to 4 pages**, including references and appendices.

Code of Conduct
---------------

All ESC participants in all regions are subject to the NYU Tandon School of Engineering [student code of conduct](http://engineering.nyu.edu/life/student-affairs/code-of-conduct). Any act of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, unauthorized collaboration across different teams, work duplication, **will not be tolerated and the offenders will be automatically disqualified from the competition**.


Contact Information
-------------------

Teams can contact their regional organizers at the following email address: `csaw-esc@nyu.edu`. To properly route each message and avoid delays in the response, each message must prepend the tag `[US-Canada]`, `[Europe]`, `[MENA]`, or `[India]` in the subject line, depending on the region of the participating team.


Responsible Disclosure
----------------------

In the event that ESC21 contestants find critical, previously undisclosed vulnerabilities during the competition's final phase, we ask that they contact CSAW ESC21 organizers so we can assist and jointly coordinate responsible disclosure procedures, if any such procedures are deemed necessary.
