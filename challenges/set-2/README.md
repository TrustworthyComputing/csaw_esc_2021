## Technical Track Challenge Point Distribution

1. FIAsco - 150
2. casino - 100
3. search - 150

## Research Track
The scoring of the challenges is at the discretion of the judges. Teams are expected to submit the patched source files, explain the vulnerabilities that were fixed, how the vulnerabilities were fixed, and provide traces.

## Clarification
Both research track and technical track teams should focus their mitigations/exploits solely on code segments where the trigger is high; solutions that involve launching/mitigating SCAs or voltage glitching outside of this region will not receive full credit.
