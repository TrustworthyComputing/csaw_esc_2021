ESC 2021 Challenge Description
==============================

This yearâ€™s challenge will focus on **side channel and fault injection attacks** targeting hardware platforms that can exfiltrate sensitive data. Competitors will demonstrate their skills using the popular **Chipwhisperer** platform in a red team/blue team scenario to either launch or mitigate these powerful attacks.

ESC 2021 consists of **two tracks**: a **research** track and a **technical** track. The research track will focus on developing side channel and fault injection attack mitigation strategies to secure target applications. The
technical track will focus on exploiting these vulnerabilities to launch attacks against a series of challenge applications running on the provided hardware platform.



## Challenge structure

The ESC21 competition is divided into three phases:

1. A preliminary **qualification phase**, where teams must compile and submit a short written report. Teams applying
for the research track should investigate mitigation techniques and what strategies they plan to use for the
final phase while technical track teams should outline techniques that they will potentially employ to solve
the series of challenges in the final phase.

2. A **final phase**, where qualified teams are invited to the *CSAW virtual event* of their region to present and demonstrate either their attack implementations (technical) or their mitigation strategies (research) on the Chipwhisperer board provided by the organizers.

3. A **timed-attack/fortify phase**, where qualified teams will be provided with a special challenge program on the day of the virtual ESC finals in their region. The contestants will then race to solve the challenge: technical track teams will attempt to mount exploits while research track teams will investigate the vulnerabilities and apply patches.

See below for more details on the requirements of each phase.


### Qualification Phase

For the qualification phase, teams should submit a **short report** that outlines approaches and techniques (not only one approach/technique) to perform side channel and fault injection attacks (technical) or to mitigate them (research). To that end, the report should also explore existing techniques on the topic, focusing on (but not necessarily limited to) attacking/mitigating attacks against cryptographic hardware. The best approaches will include a discussion of existing techniques, a clear outline of reverse engineering methodologies, and a discussion of how the methodologies will be applied in the final phase of the competition.

Qualification phase reports will be evaluated by a team of experts, and will take into account the **correctness** and **creativity** of proposed techniques, as well as the completeness and quality of the compiled report.

### Final Phase

Details will be released after the end of qualification phase.

### Timed-Attack Phase

Details will be released before the ESC 2021 finals.
