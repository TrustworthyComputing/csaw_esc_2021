## Qualification Phase

For the qualification phase, each participating team must upload **a written report** to the [HotCRP system](https://hotcrp.engineering.nyu.edu/) in PDF file format following the standard IEEE conference format (10pt font, double column, letter size paper, not compsoc mode); templates are available [here](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html) (LaTeX template is preferred). The qualification phase PDF report can be **up to 4 pages**, including references and appendices.

## FInal Phase

For the final phase, each qualified team must upload a **final PDF report** to the HotCRP system, along with a TAR.GZ file that includes all associated computer files and documentation for the implemented side-channel/fault-injection attacks/mitigations. It is recommended that the participants also upload evidence in the form of power traces for side-channel attacks along with descriptions. Final reports should follow the format of a technical paper, discussing attack implementation, findings, and any relevant documentation of all the approaches/techniques and exploits that will be demonstrated during the finals. Information pertaining to any assumptions the contestants make, thorough technical discussion, and points that address all the [grading criteria](challenge_description.md#evaluation-and-grading-policies) must be included in the reports, in a **structured manner**. We encourage contestants to also include failed attempts and how/why they were unsuccessful, in addition to their successful approaches and attempts. The final report is limited to **8 pages** including references and appendices, following the same template as the qualification report. In addition to the final reports, each team should prepare a **technical poster or presentation slides** (up to 6 slides) and a **short pre-recorded video** (10 minutes) demonstrating their work, to be presented on the day of the live finals at CSAW events.

**_We stress that final reports must be submitted in PDF format and that they MUST NOT be published or otherwise made publicly available before announcement of ALL winners in ALL global CSAW ESC regions/time zones (i.e., after 15 November 2021)._**
