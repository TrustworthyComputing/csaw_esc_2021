# Final Phase Rules

Welcome to the final phase of CSAW ESC'21! This page will provide additional details about the final challenges. We have two rules for these challenges:

1.	The challenges assume the STM micro is already programmed. **No reverse engineering or modifying of the provided hex files is allowed.** The reference C code may be provided to indicate what algorithm is being run. In the technical track, a valid solution will be evaluated **only** using the original hex files.

2.	Your solution must provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate how you solved the challenge. You **must provide any traces, source code, and scripts** necessary to process these traces, so your solution can be replicated. Each trace should indicate how the trace is generated. Any commands to invoke the scripts should also be given. Finally, you **may provide any screenshots or output messages** from the challenge. At the ESC finals, the judges and challenge organizers will test, verify and evaluate the submitted solutions of the teams on an original 'judge' board that will be programmed with the provided .hex files from this repository.

## Challenge Structure Overview

Throughout the next few weeks **several challenge sets will be released**. Each set will contain independent challenges for the teams to solve and all points from all challenges will be accumulated in the final score of each team. These points will be awarded to each team when the submitted solutions are verified by the judges and the organizers.

## Final Report Results and Verifying Solutions

When submitting the final report, each team should also upload a .zip file with all scripts used to solve the challenges (if used), as well as the correct inputs necessary to solve the challenges. In this case, each of your scripts should have the same name as the challenge it solves (clearly marked with the team name). These files and inputs will be used to verify that a team solved each challenge correctly.

The challenge leaders and judges will verify the solutions that each team has submitted before the day of the finals. On the day of the finals, each team should have a computer with all necessary files along with their ChipWhisperer Nano board. The judges can further ask teams to present their solutions for a challenge on the day of the finals.
